# **NewChic Product Analysis**

## **Task 1: Problem Analysis and Data Preprocess**
An e-commerce website NewChic.com keeps records of its products. A snapshot of records of instances are stored by categories in accessories.csv, bags.csv, beauty.csv, house.csv, jewelry.csv, kids.csv, men.csv, shoes.csv, and women.csv, which are provided to you with this instruction. A product is represented by one instance (i.e., a row). The nine CSV data sheets form the NewChic dataset. The data dictionary(.pdf) summarizes all attributes and their types in the dataset. You need to focus on integer and decimal type data (i.e., columns) where id in integer type is excluded. The rest columns will support your data analytics design and discussion.
<br /><br />
The analytics into NewChic dataset aims to find:
-	top 10 products from your selected categories, and
-	the best category among your selected categories.
<br />
To answer these two questions, you need to think about the following parts. A figure to illustrate your analytics plan is preferred.

1. Design your experiment (Task 1) and report: why would you choose all or part of data from the NewChic dataset; how would you define “top 10” and “the best”; why some columns are picked for clustering and classification algorithms and some columns are for result discussion.
2. Program data preprocess (Task 1) by combining CSVs in one sheet and report: matched, removed columns and detail explanations.
3. Use at least two clustering algorithms (Task 2) on preprocessed data and report: detail steps of each algorithm, how you preprocessed the data, the result of all algorithms in a table, algorithm comparison and best result.
4. Program at least two classification algorithms (Task 3) on preprocessed data and report: detail steps of each algorithm, result of all algorithms in a table, algorithm comparison and best result.
5. Discuss results (Task 4) and report: the 10 best products, the best category and your suggestions to NewChic.


## **Task 2: Clustering**
You are to analyze the data you preprocessed in Task1. You need to apply at least two different clustering algorithms. Justify and explain your selection! 
## **Task 3: Classification**
You are to analyze the data you preprocessed in Task1. You need to perform at least two classification algorithms and explain your selection: 
## **Task 4: Result Discussion**
Task 4 can answer the following questions and more:
-	Are the clusters well separated from each other?
-	Did the classifiers well separate products from each other into different classes?
-	Do any of the clusters/classes have only a few points?
-	Are there meaningful and non-meaningful clusters/classes to the analytics problems questioned in Task 1?
-	What are the advantages, shortages for clustering and classification algorithms in this analytics case? Which one provides results of greater value?
-	Are the examined algorithms suitable for Big Data analytics? and why in your opinion?
-	Will data preprocess affect clustering and classification results? and why in your opinion?

Finally, please report the 10 best products, the best category and your suggestions to NewChic.
